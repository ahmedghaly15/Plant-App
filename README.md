# Plant-App-UI

Plant App is a beautifully designed UI Flutter app that is perfect for plant enthusiasts. With a simple and intuitive interface, Plant App makes it easy to explore and learn about different plants.

The app consists of two screens - the Home screen and the Details screen. The Home screen provides a list of plants that you can browse through. Each plant is accompanied by a beautiful image and basic information such as the plant's name and price.

If you want to learn more about a particular plant, simply click on it to be taken to the Details screen. Here, you'll find more detailed information about the plant, including its scientific name, care instructions, and additional images.

With Plant App, you can easily discover and learn about new plants, making it the perfect app for both beginners and experienced plant enthusiasts. The app's simple and intuitive design makes it easy to use, and the beautiful images make browsing through the plants a joy.
